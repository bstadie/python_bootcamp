    "\n",
    "*Instructions:*\n",
    "First calculate the stock-level average price over the past year. Then, using the average of each stock over the past year, calculate the sector-level average price. Finaly, plot the sector-level average price. You can use any method of plotting. For example, bar chart. \n",

    "Then, group the stocks by sector. For example, stocks A and B might be in the Tech sector and C might be in the Medical sector. Then, compute the average over all stocks in each sector. In this case, we mu_tech = (mu_A + mu_B) / 2\n"
